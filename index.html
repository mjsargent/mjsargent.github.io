I am a PhD student in Department of Computer Science at University College London, supervised by Caswell Barry and Peter Bentley. I am broadly interested in how predictive state representations such as the Successor Representation can be constructed over abstracted state spaces, and the implications this may have in our studies of the hippocampal-entorhinal system. I hold an MEng in Biomedical Engineering from Imperial College London, and during my studies I was fortunate enough to win funding for undergraduate research at labs at Imperial and MIT.
