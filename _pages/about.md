I am a PhD Student at the Centre for Artificial Intelligence at University College London. I am researching abstraction and generalisation with predictive state representations; specifically I am at present looking at how Successor Representations can be constructed over abstract state spaces. I am also interested in how this might help inform our studies of the hippocampal-entorhinal system. I hold an MEng in Biomedical Engineering from Imperial College London.
