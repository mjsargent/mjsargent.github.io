This workshop paper demonstrates a method for compressing representations of expected state dynamics into a hierarchy of successor representations, using the geometric decomposition.

In this conference submission, I outline some preliminary results showing the efficacy of using successor representations that represent the expected state dynamics given an action has a finite horizon (a numver of action repeats), which is also generated under some policy.

This is work I completed during my time as a Biomedical Engineering student. We developed a low-cost, highly effective and reliable systems for monitoring the breathing rate of anesthetized rodents. We open-sourced this system, and the code and other files are provided here.
